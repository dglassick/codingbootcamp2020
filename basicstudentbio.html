        <p>Hello, my name is Derek. I am married with one son and another on the way. I currently teach 10th Grade English. 
            I love to read, play video games, watch movies, and hangout with family and friends. I enjoy drinking beer, and have even dabbled in brewing my own.
            Even though I really enjoy teaching, I feel like that career will lead to frustration if I attempt to move up to administration.
            I searched for a new career and discovered coding. Through the prework, while I was nervous about not picking up enough, I found
            really enjoyed it, and am looking forward to discovering new ways to code.
        </p>
